RSSIding
========

##Problem
Adjust antenna of 3g modem  to get maximum RSSI. Hold antena standing on a ladder or a roof and check RSSI on your laptop. Have a big fun if you're agile acrobat.

##Solutions
Exchange a computer to a smartphon. Still very inconvenient. Ask someone to look at screen and tell you what RSSI is there - better. Play high or low pitch according to RSSI level - even better.

## Hardware and software configuration

+ router with OpenWRT 
+ computer with Linux and loudspeakers

##How it works?
1. Connect to router's OpenWRT via ssh.
2. Ask modem RSSI using AT commands.
3. According to RSSI level play appropriate sound
